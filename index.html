        <h1>Html Semantics</h1>
        <p>What i learnt today was semantics html and also some basic CSS coding and also margin and padding. Ok starting right off, I have learnt that certain html functions such as paragraph or div itself has no inherent meaning, meaning that it itself is just either a container and a element. So in order to fix that, we can implement some semantics html. Some examples of semantics html are header ,footer ,details , nav, main, article and aside. So what they actually do is that they tell what certain block of elements actually mean. For example, the elements within the header section means that it contains introductory contents. Moving on, after playing around with the semantics, from the CA 1 and 2 assignments, I continued my journey with the notes and moved on to the introductory contents for CSS.

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>For css, I have learnt how to manipulate with the fonts and colors of words. Moreover, I have also learnt how to implement foreign fonts into a html code within the header section, using the <link> function. So starting right off, I would like to talk about colors. For colouring of fonts or backgrounds or anything in general, you can use the function color: ;. Within the given open space you can specify what colors you would want a certain word or background to be. It can be specific words like red, azure or purple or it can be more specific like hexadecimal numbers where you can search up the color code of certain specific numbers you want and copy and paste them. It can also be in the form of rgb ( ##, ##, ##) where like i said previously, you can go on the internet to specify the numbers in order to get a certain color that you may want. Another cool thing about CSS colors is that like similarly to the rgb() specification method, you can use the rgba (##,##,##,##) method where you can specify how transparent a color can be where 0 being transparent and 1 being opaque. Moving on, now I would like to talk more about the link function. Firstly, in the link function, you need to specify the specific link used, the href and also the type and the rel which is relationship. Furthermore, for the link function, it can either be linked to an external file or it can be linked to a link found from google where you can import different fonts onto the programming platform. Moving on, now I would like to move on to the fonts. So basically there are many forms of fonts or just words manipulations in general. You can specify the family of font(Can be imported or local e.g. or local is serif or sans serif), weight of font, size of font, style of font(italic or normal). Furthermore, you can also align the words, for example, you can make the words align in the center, right or left. Finally, moving on to the final part of what I have learnt is that you can add gradients to colors. Gradients can be radical(emanating from the center) or linear(up, down, left, right, horizontal). Gradients similarly to colors can be copied off from certain websites such as  uigradients.com. </p>
        <h1>Margin and Padding</h1>
        <p>Moving on to the final few things that I have learnt is the margin and padding. Firstly, margin: ; function in the css file helps to alter the space right outside the boundary of the box model of functions such as div and padding helps to alter the space within the boundary of the box model.</p>
