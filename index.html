        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Html Semantics</h1>
        <p>What i learnt today was semantics html and also some basic CSS coding and also margin and padding. Ok starting right off, I have learnt that certain html functions such as paragraph or div itself has no inherent meaning, meaning that it itself is just either a container and a element. So in order to fix that, we can implement some semantics html. Some examples of semantics html are header ,footer ,details , nav, main, article and aside. So what they actually do is that they tell what certain block of elements actually mean. For example, the elements within the header section means that it contains introductory contents. Moving on, after playing around with the semantics, from the CA 1 and 2 assignments, I continued my journey with the notes and moved on to the introductory contents for CSS. 
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>CSS</h1>
        <p>For css, I have learnt how to manipulate with the fonts and colors of words. Moreover, I have also learnt how to implement foreign fonts into a html code within the header section, using the link function. So starting right off, I would like to talk about colors. For colouring of fonts or backgrounds or anything in general, you can use the function 'color: ;'. Within the given open space you can specify what colors you would want a certain word or background to be. It can be specific words like red, azure or purple or it can be more specific like hexadecimal numbers where you can search up the color code of certain specific numbers you want and copy and paste them. It can also be in the form of rgb ( ##, ##, ##) where like i said previously, you can go on the internet to specify the numbers in order to get a certain color that you may want. Another cool thing about CSS colors is that like similarly to the rgb() specification method, you can use the rgba (##,##,##,##) method where you can specify how transparent a color can be where 0 being transparent and 1 being opaque. Moving on, now I would like to talk more about the link function. Firstly, in the link function, you need to specify the link, the href and also the type and the rel which is relationship. Furthermore, for the link function, it can either be linked to an external file or it can be linked to a link found from google where you can import different fonts onto the programming platform. Moving on, now I would like to move on to the fonts. So basically there are many forms of fonts or just words manipulations in general. You can specify the family of font(Can be imported or local e.g. or local is serif or sans serif), weight of font, size of font, style of font(italic or normal). Furthermore, you can also align the words, for example, you can make the words align in the center, right or left. Finally, moving on to the final part of what I have learnt is that you can add gradients to colors. Gradients can be radical(emanating from the center) or linear(up, down, left, right, horizontal). Gradients similarly to colors can be copied off from certain websites such as  uigradients.com. </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Margin and Padding</h1>
        <p>Moving on to the final few things that I have learnt is the margin and padding. Firstly, margin: ; function in the css file helps to alter the space right outside the boundary of the box model of functions such as div and padding helps to alter the space within the boundary of the box model.</p>

        <h1 class = 'officialheading'>Week 3 Blog update</h1>
        <h1 class ='specialheading'>Forms</h1>
        <p>So for my flipped learning session for week 3 materials the first thing that I have come accorss is forms.
        </p>
        <p>Forms are basically elements within a page where you can collect data and transport it to a specified website that you choose, which is under the action part.
        In order for a form to be successfu;, you would need input elements whre a end user can input data into a form.
        In addition, the form of data input can also be specified. You can make it a password, email ,checkbox or even radio which is something like a mcq checkbox.
        To further improve the design of a input, you can add labels to them, allowing users to know specifically what input to place into the boxes.
        Other than labels, you can also have placeholders, similarly to labels, it helps to label out what a input box would want to receive.
        Additionally, you can also make your inputs 'required' such that it makes an input part of a form compulsory.
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Descendant selectors</h1>
        <p>Within html elements, There can also be descendant selectors where you can include specific elements within another element.
        For example, you can add a hyperlink to a paragraph element. It is also noted that it is a best practice that you should only have 3 descendant selectors.
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>CSS grouping</h1>
        <p>Now moving on to the css section of this week's notes.
            So starting right off, I have learnt that you can group elements together in order to style them together in the css section. What do i mean by that is that
            you can style both a paragraph or section element at the same time in the css file by just including a comma.
            Next, I have learnt more about precendence order in which a css file would read the codes. Certain elements would have more specificity than others.
            For example, a class element would take precendece over a paragraph. Meaning that if both elements were styled and used in a element in the html code, the class styling would be carried out instead of the paragraph one.
            However, you can eradicate this rule if you just add the !important to the element in the css file. This allows the specific element to take precedence over all others, regardless of the previous rule that I had just stated.
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Additional CSS styling</h1>
        <P>Another cool thing that I have learnt is that you can add images to the background. The background can be specified, it can either be your body, paragraph or maybe even a section
            Additionally, I have also learnt that you can add borders to any elements that you would want. This creates an outline around your element. You can specify the style, colour and even size of it.

        </P>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Media Queries</h1>

        <p> Media Queries allows you to specify the CSS styling in accordance to the device a user is using. For example, you can @media and (width: 576px). 
            This code allows you to edit how the webpage would look like to mobile users. Furthermore, you can also specify the media types, for example : screens.

        </p>

        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>CSS Positioning</h1>
        <p> Positioning allows you to position your elements however you would want them to do so. In this weeks notes, I have learnt about 3 of them.
            Those are absolute,relative and fixed. So starting right off, absolute positioning makes a element's position relative to a parent element that has a absolute positioning. If no parent element has absolute positioning, the element would just be relative to the browser screen. Meaning that if lessay
            you add top: 0px;, left: 0px; and position: absolute; to a box, the box would be positioned at the top left hand side of a browser. Moving on, there is relative. This positioning allows you to alter the positioning of an element in relative to its original positioning.
            Next, there is the fixed positioning. It is similiar to absolute but unlike it, it will always be relative to the window's browser instead of a parent element and it is also a sticky element, where it does not scroll with the rest of the page.
            Moving on, there is also a z-index which helps to specify which elements are on top of one another, something like stacking (gentle note: z-index only works on elements wit a specified positioning like the 3 ones i stated above).
            A negative z-index would mean the element would be at the bottom and a positive one would mean the element would be at the top.


        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Flexbox</h1>
        <p>Currently, even after reading the notes, I am still unsure what a flexbox is. Guess I would have to wait till lesson starts to learn more about it.</p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Wireframe</h1>
        <p>Similiarly to flexboox, I am still alittle unsure as to what wireframes are, so I would not document about it until lesson has started.</p>
        <h1 class = 'officialheading'>Week 3 Day 2 </h1>
        <p> Now that the teacher has explained it in more detail, I have come to understand better what wireframes and flexboxes are. Wireframes are essentially a blueprint to a website and 
            a flexbox is like a container where you can fit elements within it. Upsides of it being that you can alter the alignment, direction and also the order of the elements inside it.</p>
        <p>Example of a flexbox</p>
        <div class = 'flexboxes'>
            <div>1</div>
            <div>2</div>
            </div>
        <span class='break'>Moving to next week</span>
        <h1 class = 'officialheading'>Week 4 blog update</h1>
        <p>For this week's lesson I have learnt what is a responsive image and what is a git.</p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Responsive image</h1>
        <p>For responsive images ther are 2 ways to do it. One way is through maximum: and the other is through src set
        Maximum allows imagaes to scale down to size but never bigger than what the maximum is set to and the src set allows images
            of different resolution to fit in the different screen sizes. It is actually quite amazing, something similiar of that to the media query
        </p>
        <p>In addition, you can also fit an image inside a given box by using the background-size: cover function</p>
        <p>An example would be:</p>
        <div class = 'img'>
        </div>
        <h1 class ='specialheading'>Git</h1>
        <p>Git is a version control system. It helps you to control different versions of a project that you may have. For example, you can reset file contents to the previous version as you see fit
        In addition, git can also help keep track of the history of changes that you make to the file and also why you make those changes. This all in all helps a website creater to have better clarity on what he is doing
        All in all, git is very useful</p>
        <span class='break'>Moving to next week</span>
        <h1 class = 'officialheading'> Week 5 blog update</h1>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'></h1>
        <p>So basically for the whole of this week, I'v learnt more about javascript and how to execute it.
            Firstly, to start things off, I would like to talk more about objects and classes. Objects are basically instances of classes.
            How it works is that in a javascript file you initiate it by using class (whatever class name you want) {you insert ur properties and etc
            }. This is extremely useful as it helps you to create objects which is extremely important in this language.
            Moving on, there is also functions which I have learnt. Functions are similiar to methods that I have learnt in C#. The way it works is that you can either initiate it in a class or you can create One.
            For example, function functionName(){insert what you want this function to do}. Functions pretty much helps  you to have more interactions with the webpages itself and it is extremely useful.
            Other than functions and classes and objects, I have also learnt how to use the queryselector and getElementsbyclass name or id method which helps you the select elements by their class name which is useful as in a function you usually need those
            in order for you to select specific elements and make changes to them. 
        </p>
        <p> An example : <button onclick = "redcolor()">&#xb0;</button>
        </p>
        <p class = "red">See me change</p>
        <span class='break'>Moving to next week</span>
        <h1 class = 'officialheading'> Week 6 blog update</h1>
        <p>So what I have learnt this week is basically more advanced materials on JavaScript</p>
        <h1 class ='specialheading'>Basics</h1>
        <p>So under this week's section, I have learnt of the different type of data types. Similiarly to other languages, there is 3 types. The boolean, number and string type.
            I have also learnt that Javascript has dynamic typing, meaning that you can add a named variable to a string of text.
            Next,I have learnt more about template literals where you can add defined variables in js codes. Its kind of hard to explain but for example,
            var y = 5 console.log(`This number is ${y}`). Something along the lines of this. Moving on, I have also learnt of the different types of comparison and logical operator.
            === is the Strict equal and == is the non-strict one, strict one meaning it takes into account data types while the non-one does not.
            Similiarly to C#, && is (and) and || is or and ! is not. Theres also some basic ones like >,greater than, etc.(nothing really special about this component). 
            Similairly, there is also loops. In this chapter, I have learnt of 3 different types of loops. The for loop, while loop and for of loop. For and while are the same and the for of loop is like the foreach loop in C#.
            Moving on. Arrays. The cool thing about arrays in javascriot is that you can skip indexes and also have a multitude of data types in a single array. Additionally, there is also a 2d array.
            Which is basically an array with 2 layers. Lastly, theres the associate array which is pretty much like a dictionary, where instead of using numbers for indexes, you can use string. 
        </p>
        <h1 class ='specialheading'>Objects</h1>
        <p>In this week's material, we pretty much have a recap on what objects are. Since I have basically wrote down a rough description last week, Im not going to dwell much on it.
            So Objects are basically a group together of a set of variables and functions to create a model. Like in real life. We can have properties and functions inside of them. You can also create objects via functions,
            i.e. function(name){this.name = name; checkname function(){console.log(this.name)}}.Moving on, I have also learnt more about the var, let and const types. Let is block scoped while var if I am not wrong is global scoped and const are variables that remain constant.

        </p>
        <h1 class="specialheading">DOM</h1>
        <p>I have learnt what a DOM tree is and how to select the elements within it. Methods goes as shows
            getElementById();,querySelector();,getElementsByClassName();,getElementsByTagName();,querySelectorAll().
            Next there is also the element.classname which allows you to access the class name of the specific element. There is also the 
            element.innerHTML and element.textContent. Both are similiar and the difference is that innerHTML makes it so that the browser treat it as a html while textcontent does not
        </p>
        <span class='break'>Moving to next week</span>
        <h1 class = 'officialheading'> Week 7 blog update</h1>
        <h1 class="specialheading">DOM</h1>
        <p>In this week, I have learnt more on the DOM Structure. Like I have said previously, it is similiar to a hierachy of elements within the html document itself.
            To access each of these elements, you must first use the document key word. E.G.: document.getElementsByTagName();. So now that is out of the way, I would like to talk more on the new things that I have learnt.
            Tbh theres nothing much new except the fact that you can use the previousSibling or nextSibling methods and also the firstChild and lastChild method which I think is pretty self explanatory where the firstChild method you select the first chid of a parent element and likewise for last and same with nextSibling method which is just like the name implies, it allows you to 
            select the previous or next sibling from the DOM tree. Moving on, lets now look at the Event handling and Validation topic.
        </p>
        <h1 class="specialheading">Event handling and validation</h1>
        <p>This topic is actually quite interesting and useful. So starting off you are able to pretty much in my own words capture the events that happens to certain specified element(/s) and manipulate it any way you would want it to.
            Heres how you do it :(element.addEventListener('event', functionName, [Boolean]);)
            For an event there is also an event object where it tells information about the event, and the element it happened upon
            Next, there is also the event bubbling which is pretty much what the boolean is needed for in the addEventListener. To put it simply, (an example from the notes btw)
            A click on the inner p element first runs onclick.
            <ol>
            <li> On that p.</li>
            <li>Then on the outer div.</li>
            <li> Then on the outer form. </li>
            <li> And so on upwards till the document object</li> 
            </ol>
            Next, theres 2 interesting functions in which I would like to talk about.
            Firstly, the event.preventDefault(). This function is used when you want to prevent the default behavior of an element (e.g to keep the user on the same page
            to perform validation).
            Secondly, the event.stopPropagation(). This function is used when you want to stop the event from bubbling up.
            Nextly, I would like to talk more about some events that could be manipulated/captured when creating a website. Heres a list of the UI events
            which are events that occur when a user interacts with the browser's user interface (UI) rather than the webpage.
            List goes as shows: <ol><li>load (Web page has finished loading)</li>
            <li>unload (Web page is unloading (usually because a new page was requested))</li>
            <li>error (Browser encounters a JavaScript error or an asset doesn't exist)</li>
            <li>resize (Browser window has been resized)</li>
            <li>scroll (User has scrolled up or down the page)</li></ol>
            Of course there are more events like onclick or onchange and stuffs like that but I am not going to write all of it down.
            Next, moving onto forms and validation.


        </p>
        <h1 class="specialheading">Forms and Validation</h1>
        <p>Starting off, normally for most websites with login features or other features, you need to validate certain aspects of an input like
            creation of account name,password and etc. For most validations, we would want to make sure that we validate it on a client side first so that
            we can save time that would be wasted on doing validation at the server itself. Here is how you can validate forms 
            <ul>
            <li>Add event handler to the keyUp event</li>   
            <li>Add event handler to the blur event</li>
            <li>Add event handler to the submit... many more..</li></ul>
            
        </p>
        <p>Next, moving on to forms or the new things I have learnt about it. Firstly, there is a cool new feature where you can make radio buttons/checkboxes or other inputs
            'disabled'(where users cannot select them). You can also create a drop down menu. You do so by enveloping a bunch of options with values within a 'select'.
            Like with most other elements, you can assign ids to forms or inputs to be able to retrieve them later in javascript.
            
        </p>
        <h1 class="specialheading">Local Storage</h1>
        <p>Most browser store up to 5MB of data per domain in a storage object and if a site requires more than 5MB of data, the broswer will typically ask the user for permission to store data(never rely on users agreeing to give a site more
            space). “QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR” is the exception that will get
            thrown if you exceed your storage quota of 5 megabytes. You do try and catch if you wana do something when the website reaches this error. E.g.</p>
            <p>try {</p>
                <p> localStorage.setItem(data.name,JSON.stringify(data));</p>
                    <p> } catch(domException) {</p>
                        <p>  if (domException.name === 'QuotaExceededError' ||</p>
                            <p>  domException.name === 'NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED')</p>
                                <p>  {</p>
                                    <p> // Fallback code comes here.</p>
                                        <p>  }</p>
                                            <p>  }</p>
                
           <p> Local storages are based on key/values pairs(Something like dictionaries in python and C#).
            There are 2 main types of local storages, Local and session. They both have the same methods to get and set data, but each lasts a
            different amount of time. For security, browsers employ a
            same origin policy, which means that
            data can only be accessed by other pages
            in the same origin. Some examples would include that, Protocol, Subdomain, Domain, Port must match.
            So how do you start with local storage, you start with this: localStorage.setItem(key, value) or
            sessionStorage.setItem(key, value) and to get the items, you do this: localStorage.getItem(key) or
            sessionStorage.getItem(key).Another thing to note is that you can treat the storage as an array meaning, you can 
            get an item like this localStorage["name of key"].
        </p>
        <p>Now lets move onto JSON. JSON is somewhat similiar to an object(like the format)
            but it just contains data. This is how it looks like {
                "name": "Pikachu",
                "hp": 200,
                "attack": 999,
                "defense": 999,
                "type": "electric"
                }. Similiarly, it is made up of keys and values pairs.The values can be a string,
                number, Boolean, array, object or
                null. So in order to utilise json well, javascript has 2 important methods on how to manipulate json to help you out.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Convert a JavaScript object to a string:
                        -JSON.stringify();
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Convert a string to a JavaScript object:
                        -JSON.parse();
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>Heres an example on how to utilise json.
                <p>function Pokemon(name, hp, attack, defense, color, type) {</p>
                    <p>  this.name = name;</p>
                        <p> this.hp = hp;</p>
                            <p>  this.attack = attack;</p>
                                <p>  this.defense = defense;</p>
                                    <p>  this.color = color;</p>
                                        <p>  this.type = type;</p>
                                            <p>  }</p>
                                                <p> //let's create our base and store pikachu</p>
                                                    <p>  let pikachu = new Pokemon("Pikachu", 100, 9, 8, "yellow", "electric");</p>
                                                        <p>  //</p>
                                                            <p>  let giantPokeBall = [];</p>
                                                                <p> giantPokeBall.push(pikachu);</p>
                    <p> localStorage.setItem("pokemonList", JSON.stringify(giantPokeBall));</p>

                   <p> Next, moving onto how to clear storages, you can do the localStorage.clear() function or localStorage.removeItem(item key) function.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion, in this week, I have learnt how to manipulate DOM events, handle forms and store data on local storages</p>

    <h1 class="officialheading">Week 8 blog updates</h1>
    <h1 class="specialheading">JQuery</h1>
    <p>Starting off, in this week, I have learnt how to utilise jquery which is like javascript but a short cut version(shorter length i mean).
        For example, $('li.hot') = li element with the class 'hot'. Now that you have selected an element or elements, you can now apply many functions to them or manipulate them how ever you would want them to be </p>
        <p>like. For example, $('div').css({</p>
            <p>'background-color' : 'green',</p>
                <p>'color' : 'white'</p>
                    <p> })(setting all div elements to have background color of green and normal color of white).</p>
        <p>Also do note that 
        if a selector returns more than 1 element,
        the modification will affect all of them.
    </p>
    <p>Now in jquery, you can also choose to either manipulate the html or text content(I think the name is pretty self explanatory so imma not explaiin it further).</p>
    <p>E.g. :$('li').html('(b)Updated(b)')(imagine the brackets are > arrows)</p>
    <p> You can also set attributes to elements by doing this: $('a').attr('href', 'newvalue') -- set the value of
        the href attribute. Another example: $(".highlight").attr("class",
        "special") </p>
        <p>Do take note: you can also add classes, remove classes or attributes using the functions: .addClass(), .removeClass() ,.removeAttr() respecitively(list is not exhausted).</p>
    <p>
        Moving on, in order to make things simplier, you can use the certain functions in order to help you select specific elements better. Some of this functions include(not all)
        prev(),next(),parent() and children(). Do note that you can stack each of these on one another. You can also use Remove() function to remove specific elements from the DOM.
        Next, there is also a clone() method which is pretty self explanatory but do note that the cloning stacks, meaning that you cannot spam it or it will crash your webpage.
    </p>
    <p>Moving on, you can also store variables within a html5 element by using data attributes. E.g. : < a href="google.com" data-tooltip="Go to google" >Google.com< /a ></p>
    <p>Oh yah one more thing, you can also use the hasClass() function to check if a HTML element has the specified class.</p>  
    <p>Now moving onto creating of elements. I think I have wrote this down in around week 5 but imma still recap it as it has been quite a while. Here is how you do so: 
        var n = $("< p >Hello World< /p >");
        $("body").append(n).
        Oh yah, other than appending, you can also se the functions: prepend(), after() and before(). Appending adds it to the specified element, e.g. appending to li adds the specified thing within < li > but after the already existing elements. after() adds the element after the specified element, not within.
    </p>  
    <p>Moving on, there is also Live NodeList and Static NodeList which are applied to examples such as getElementById() and querySelector() respectively.
        So basically the difference is that in the static NodeList, they reflect the document
        when the query was made. If the script changes the
        content of the page, the NodeList is not updated to
        reflect those changes. While the in the Live NodeList, when your script updates the page, the
        NodeList is updated at the same time(Quite self-explanatory imo just think about livestreams and normal videos).  
    </p>
    <p>
        Within jquery, theres also a few notable functions in jquery that I find pretty interesting. For example, .slideUp() and .animate() as they are both animation related functions.

    </p>
    <p>In short summary, jquery is pretty much a shortform version of javascript as it can really cut down the amount of lines of codes needed</p>
    <p>Now lets move onto another topic which I have learnt Api.</p>
    <h1 class="specialheading">
        API
    </h1>
    <p>
        Starting off I would like to talk about something called AJAX. AJAX stands for  Asynchronous Javascript and XML. 
        So essentially, it is a technique that allows a webpage to have its contents to be updated without having the whole page being updated. Its most popular uses of it includes things like the 
        google live searches. What i mean is that with AJAX, websites can send and request data from a server in the background without disturbing the entire page and updating a specific element of a page.
    </p>
    <p>How AJAX WORKS</p>
    <ol><li> Create an XMLHTTP
        Request</li>
        <li> Create a callback function</li>
            <li> Open a request</li>
                <li>Send the request</li></ol>
    <p>A XML is something like to HTML but tag name are different</p>
    <p>It has both benefits and downsides. For example, Flexible data form and can represent
        complex data structures and Considered as verbose language due to
        the tags adding lots of extra character.</p>
    <p>So now lets look at how to create requests with javascript. To be honest, im not very sure about what it is yet but I do know that
        from the notes, there are 3 ways on how to make the requests and those are: XMLHTTP Request, Fetch API and lastly 3rd Party Libraries(jQuery).
    </p>
  
    <p>Now lets move onto API. From what I understand, API stands for Application Programming Interface and it can be thought of like a waiter 
        that sends requests and deliver the answers to you. It starts off taking your requests(or orders in this scenario) and brings it to the kitchen and takes 
        the response (the item menu that you ordered) and bring it back to you. Something like a messenger. 
        Upon further reading, Iv learnt that the response that you get from api can be like a json string data (Maybe not 100% of the time not very sure) and hence you need to parse it and convert it into javascript objects,
        something like the local storages thing that I talked abt previously in week 7, before you can start using it. 
    </p>
    <p>In addition to api, I have also learnt how to create a fetch. I think this is the general format of which I have learnt from in the 
        polite mall. fetch(url, {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify({
            name: 'red',
            login: 'redmonster',
            })
            })
            .then(function (data) {
            //return data.json();
            //do something
            })
            .then(function (data) {
            //process the return earlier
            }).
            .catch(function (error){
            //handle error
            }). Another thing to note is that fetch is just an HTTP response and if we want to extract the JSON body content from the response, we use the json() method.
    </p>
    <p>Also another no brainer thing to note, you can also add ajax with api i mean makes sense right you use api to get data and ajax to like update your page accordingly</p>
    <p>though sadly to say im still not 100% sure on how to do it. I will get back to this topic upon further reading.</p>
    <p>Ok now onto recaps so basically what I have learnt in this week is jquery and api. Jquery is what i would call shortform or shortened javascript and api is like a waiter for data and ajax is something that is used for concurrent updating of data in a website.
        Now lets look forward to week 9 updates.
    </p>
    <span class='break'>Moving to next week</span>
    <h1 class="officialheading">Week 9 blog updates</h1>
    <p>Ok lah to be honest. In this week, theres not really much to explain so bascially what I have learnt in this week is how to use 
        bootstrap. To summarize it, it is something like something that you can import it or download it from the internet and what it does is 
        that it makes designing for websites <b>SO MUCH MORE EASIER</b>. So lets say you want to create a
        card for example, you can just go to the bootstrap website and click on card section and it will have a format there ready to be manipulated into a way that you would want.
        Funny thing to note, the formats revolves around classes so like when you want to create a card right, you copy the format and upon further looking you can see that the div classes
        are usually related to the current topic like in this case the div class is just 'card' so what I would want to say is that it is pretty easy to manipulate around with bootstrap. Just know the specific class names that you need
        and the correct format and you are good to go. </p>
    <p>So now moving onto the second part of the notes in week 9, theres charts. To be honest, its not really much
        it just talks about what certain charts are and what they are used for. Some of which I have already learnt in geography in like secondary 3-4 or datascience in sem 1 
        so imma just note down the new things I have learnt. So starting off, radar chart. Radar chart is a way of showing multiple data points and variations between them. To put it simply,
        its like character stats like think of the jojo stats kind of thing its a chart that allows you to see how like a character or a thing or an event would differ in each of these so called 'stats'.
        And yah thats about it. I hope to learn something more interesting next week. Like animation or something.
