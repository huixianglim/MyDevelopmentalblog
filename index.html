        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Html Semantics</h1>
        <p>What i learnt today was semantics html and also some basic CSS coding and also margin and padding. Ok starting right off, I have learnt that certain html functions such as paragraph or div itself has no inherent meaning, meaning that it itself is just either a container and a element. So in order to fix that, we can implement some semantics html. Some examples of semantics html are header ,footer ,details , nav, main, article and aside. So what they actually do is that they tell what certain block of elements actually mean. For example, the elements within the header section means that it contains introductory contents. Moving on, after playing around with the semantics, from the CA 1 and 2 assignments, I continued my journey with the notes and moved on to the introductory contents for CSS.

        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>CSS</h1>
        <p>For css, I have learnt how to manipulate with the fonts and colors of words. Moreover, I have also learnt how to implement foreign fonts into a html code within the header section, using the link function. So starting right off, I would like to talk about colors. For colouring of fonts or backgrounds or anything in general, you can use the function 'color: ;'. Within the given open space you can specify what colors you would want a certain word or background to be. It can be specific words like red, azure or purple or it can be more specific like hexadecimal numbers where you can search up the color code of certain specific numbers you want and copy and paste them. It can also be in the form of rgb ( ##, ##, ##) where like i said previously, you can go on the internet to specify the numbers in order to get a certain color that you may want. Another cool thing about CSS colors is that like similarly to the rgb() specification method, you can use the rgba (##,##,##,##) method where you can specify how transparent a color can be where 0 being transparent and 1 being opaque. Moving on, now I would like to talk more about the link function. Firstly, in the link function, you need to specify the link, the href and also the type and the rel which is relationship. Furthermore, for the link function, it can either be linked to an external file or it can be linked to a link found from google where you can import different fonts onto the programming platform. Moving on, now I would like to move on to the fonts. So basically there are many forms of fonts or just words manipulations in general. You can specify the family of font(Can be imported or local e.g. or local is serif or sans serif), weight of font, size of font, style of font(italic or normal). Furthermore, you can also align the words, for example, you can make the words align in the center, right or left. Finally, moving on to the final part of what I have learnt is that you can add gradients to colors. Gradients can be radical(emanating from the center) or linear(up, down, left, right, horizontal). Gradients similarly to colors can be copied off from certain websites such as  uigradients.com. </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Margin and Padding</h1>
        <p>Moving on to the final few things that I have learnt is the margin and padding. Firstly, margin: ; function in the css file helps to alter the space right outside the boundary of the box model of functions such as div and padding helps to alter the space within the boundary of the box model.</p>

        <h1 class ='specialheading'>Forms</h1>
        <p>So for my flipped learning session for week 3 materials the first thing that I have come accorss is forms.
        </p>
        <p>Forms are basically elements within a page where you can collect data and transport it to a specified website that you choose, which is under the action part.
        In order for a form to be successfu;, you would need input elements whre a end user can input data into a form.
        In addition, the form of data input can also be specified. You can make it a password, email ,checkbox or even radio which is something like a mcq checkbox.
        To further improve the design of a input, you can add labels to them, allowing users to know specifically what input to place into the boxes.
        Other than labels, you can also have placeholders, similarly to labels, it helps to label out what a input box would want to receive.
        Additionally, you can also make your inputs 'required' such that it makes an input part of a form compulsory.
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Descendant selectors</h1>
        <p>Within html elements, There can also be descendant selectors where you can include specific elements within another element.
        For example, you can add a hyperlink to a paragraph element. It is also noted that it is a best practice that you should only have 3 descendant selectors.
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>CSS grouping</h1>
        <p>Now moving on to the css section of this week's notes.
            So starting right off, I have learnt that you can group elements together in order to style them together in the css section. What do i mean by that is that
            you can style both a paragraph or section element at the same time in the css file by just including a comma.
            Next, I have learnt more about precendence order in which a css file would read the codes. Certain elements would have more specificity than others.
            For example, a class element would take precendece over a paragraph. Meaning that if both elements were styled and used in a element in the html code, the class styling would be carried out instead of the paragraph one.
            However, you can eradicate this rule if you just add the !important to the element in the css file. This allows the specific element to take precedence over all others, regardless of the previous rule that I had just stated.
        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Additional CSS styling</h1>
        <P>Another cool thing that I have learnt is that you can add images to the background. The background can be specified, it can either be your body, paragraph or maybe even a section
            Additionally, I have also learnt that you can add borders to any elements that you would want. This creates an outline around your element. You can specify the style, colour and even size of it.

        </P>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Media Queries</h1>

        <p> Media Queries allows you to specify the CSS styling in accordance to the device a user is using. For example, you can @media and (width: 576px). 
            This code allows you to edit how the webpage would look like to mobile users. Furthermore, you can also specify the media types, for example : screens.

        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>CSS Positioning</h1>
        <p> Positioning allows you to position your elements however you would want them to do so. In this weeks notes, I have learnt about 3 of them.
            Those are absolute,relative and fixed. So starting right off, absolute positioning makes a element's position relative to a parent element that has a absolute positioning. If no parent element has absolute positioning, the element would just be relative to the browser screen. Meaning that if lessay
            you add top: 0px;, left: 0px; and position: absolute; to a box, the box would be positioned at the top left hand side of a browser. Moving on, there is relative. This positioning allows you to alter the positioning of an element in relative to its original positioning.
            Next, there is the fixed positioning. It is similiar to absolute but unlike it, it will always be relative to the window's browser instead of a parent element and it is also a sticky element, where it does not scroll with the rest of the page.
            Moving on, there is also a z-index which helps to specify which elements are on top of one another, something like stacking (gentle note: z-index only works on elements wit a specified positioning like the 3 ones i stated above).
            A negative z-index would mean the element would be at the bottom and a positive one would mean the element would be at the top.


        </p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Flexbox</h1>
        <p>Currently, even after reading the notes, I am still unsure what a flexbox is. Guess I would have to wait till lesson starts to learn more about it.</p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Wireframe</h1>
        <p>Similiarly to flexboox, I am still alittle unsure as to what wireframes are, so I would not document about it until lesson has started.</p>
        <h1 class = 'specialheading'>Week 3 Day 2 </h1>
        <p> Now that the teacher has explained it in more detail, I have come to understand better what wireframes and flexboxes are. Wireframes are essentially a blueprint to a website and 
            a flexbox is like a container where you can fit elements within it. Upsides of it being that you can alter the alignment, direction and also the order of the elements inside it.</p>
